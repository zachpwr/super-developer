# Super Developer

Welcome to __Super Developer__ -- the starting point for web development workshops at Binghamton University's Emerging Technology Studio. This project contains the basic code and file structure that will be used in ETS web development workshops.

## About the Workshop
Binghamton University's Emerging Technology Studio (ETS) is offering a new regular workshop on introductory web development. Designed for coding beginners, this workshop is aimed at teaching the basics of front-end development using _HTML, CSS, and Javascript_.

### What will I learn?
Great question! If you're interested in learning how to make your own website, then you should come to the ETS during one of our scheduled workshops. During this class, you will learn the three main components to creating a basic website. By the end, you will have your very own online portfolio and public domain name.

### How much does this workshop cost?
This course is __free__ to students and staff of Binghamton University.

### Are there any prerequisites?
This course is aimed at complete beginners. Therefore, you don't need any prior coding experience to participate. However, we do ask that you complete the following before arriving:

* Bring a profile picture for your website:
  * Google Drive, USB drives, and email are great ways of getting your picture onto the ETS computers.
  * Don't have a picture? No worries! We can provide a placeholder profile picture for your new website.

### How long does the workshop take?
You can expect to spend about 1.5 hours at the ETS on the day of your scheduled workshop. Each workshop is a start-to-finish tutorial, meaning you will not have to come to the ETS multiple times to complete the course.
